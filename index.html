    <h1> Calossa Part 1 - Yellowstone Adventures </h1>
    <h4> <i> By Leena </i> </h4>
    <h2> Chapter 1 - A mysterious force </h2>
    <p> This is a story that happened in the World War 3 which was a disastrous war happening in the 2167. </p>
    
    <p> Those days near the Yellowstone lived two Chixyleen siblings named Lilasceen Chixyleen and Liandra Chixyleen. Their father went out (with a group of others) to bring peace in the world and they lived alone with their mother. </p>
    
    <p> Once a message came to the Chixyleens. It read: </p>
    
    <p> <i> Tammin Chixyleen </i> (who was their father) <i> has got a death sentence and will be killed by tomorrow. His last wish is attached in this letter: </i></p>
    <p> <i> Goodbye... You have to find out the secret of Calossa from Yellowstone volcano and spring girls... Don't worry, You'll do very good without me </i></p>
    <p><i> Signed by Vigind </i></p>
    <p> The Chixyleens cried and cried and cried until Liandra pointed out that they should not waste time. </p>
